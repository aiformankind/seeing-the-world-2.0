# Seeing The World

AI For Mankind’s Seeing the World Project wants to make the physical world more accessible and navigable to people who are blind or have low vision.

If an autonomous vehicle can drive itself, we strongly believe we can enable people who are blind or have low vision to navigate the world with ease.

Imagine a world where people who are blind or have low vision do not need a white cane to walk around. They go around doing chores like grocery shopping just like everyone else. Isn’t it wonderful ? Is it possible ? We believe so. It will not be easy for sure, but it is totally possible.

Seeing the World project is proud to be selected as one of the [Microsoft AI for Accessibility](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-accessibility)’s grantees.
